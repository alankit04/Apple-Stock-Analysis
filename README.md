# <h1>Apple-Stock-Analysis</h1>

**<h2>Project Overview**<h2>
This project aims to predict the future stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using historical stock data. This project analyses past stock prices by leveraging Time Series Analysis and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. It predicts future trends, providing a valuable tool for investors and analysts.
**<h2>Objectives**<h2>
Predict future stock prices of Apple Inc. using historical price data.Utilize Time Series Analysis techniques to process and prepare the data.Build and train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to capture the temporal patterns and dependencies in the data. Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics and visualize predictions.
**<h2>Project Structure<h2>**
Data: Contains the raw historical stock data of Apple (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance or another source.
IDE: Jupyter notebooks with the code for data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.
Model: Contains saved models for prediction.
Requirements.txt: List of dependencies for the project (e.g., TensorFlow, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, etc.).
app.py: The script to run predictions and visualize results.
Output: Folder containing the predicted results and visualizations.
**<h2>Technology Using</h2>**
Python: A programming language for the project.
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework for building the LSTM model.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computing.
matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization tools for plotting stock prices and predictions.
scikit-learn: For splitting the dataset and scaling the data.
**<h2>Dataset</h2>**
The dataset consists of daily stock prices for Apple Inc. (AAPL) that include the following columns:
Date: The date of the stock data.
Open: The price at which the stock opened.
High: The highest price of the day.
Low: The lowest price of the day.
Close: The closing price of the stock.
Volume: The number of shares traded.
**Model Working**
Time Series Analysis: The stock prices are treated as a time series, where past prices influence future values. We preprocess the data by scaling and transforming it to fit the model.
LSTM Model: A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. The LSTM model is trained on the historical stock data to predict future stock prices.
